Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) is a graphic statics-based method for finding the
shape of a spatial network of compressive forces in equilibrium with vertical loads applied
to its vertices.

By allowing only vertical loads, horizontal and vertical equilibrium of the network
can be solved separately.

Horizontal equilibrium is controlled by two reciprocal diagrams, often called the form
and force diagram.

The form diagram defines the layout of the vertices and edges of the spatial network
projected onto a horizontal plane. Therfore, the form diagram defines the directions
along which horizontal (compression) forces can flow through the network.

The force diagram defines the magnitudes of those horizontal forces up to a scale
factor.

Horizontal equilibrium is established when the two diagrams are reciprocal.
