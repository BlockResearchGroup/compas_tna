Horizontal
==========

Algorithms related to horizontal equilibrium of the form diagram and thus of the
corresponding thrust network.

Horizontal equilibrium is established when the form and force diagram are reciprocal.
Two diagrams are said to be reciprocal if they are each other's dual and if all
corresponding edges are at any specific constant angle.

Note that for legibility, the form and force diagrams in ``compas_tna`` are drawn
such that corresponding edges of reciprocal diagrams are perpendicular.
However, the diagrams are made reciprocal by parallelising the corresponding edges.
The diagrams are thus rotated by 90 degrees and back at the beginning and end of
each of the horizontal equilibrium algorithms.

Proxies
-------

The ``_numpy`` variants of the above functions can be used directly in Rhino using an RPC server proxy.

Note that whenever the original algorithm expects a diagram instance as parameter,
the corresponding proxy function will expect the data representing that diagram
instead. The data representing the diagram is stored in the ``data`` attribute of the
diagram.

>>> tna = Proxy('compas_tna.equilibrium')
>>> horizontal = tna.horizontal_nodal_numpy_proxy

Once the proxy is created, it can be used like an actual function with the same signature.

>>> formdata, forcedata = horizontal(form.data, force.data)
>>> form.data = formdata
>>> force.data = forcedata
